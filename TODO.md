# To Do List for Jockle

1. New/Add inventory item functionality
2. Edit button in the details panel - deactivated if no item is selected
3. Add/Remove items from inventory in the panel (what happens if we get to zero or <0)?
4. Drop all button in details? With an "are you sure" screen?
5. Can we have tabs on the top to "tag" the items in a category and they can go somewhere?
   1. What are the tags that we want?
   2. We don't want these tags to be custom to be honest
6. Need to edit the DB to add this "categorization" factor
7. Need to add a bunch more icons for starting
8. New/Add inventory should allow icon selection with a icon panel? Similar to our card selection and search functionality, we can reuse stuff here
9. Can we somehow get the icon to show up in the details?
10. Items should have stats - need to have a specific item + stats table in the database
    1.  There was an example on the secret repo called testing.html
11. Can items have weight? How can we calculate this?
12. Can we interlay this all with a character screen at the start? How are we going to seed this?
    1.  The character screen should *not* be overly critical right now
    2.  Simply have the characters have a "max weight" and the calculation should show whether they are over the weight threshold.
    3.  Should we show these metrics at the bottom of the inventory screen? Is there something we can do here? What more do we want to add?
    4.  Maybe we should put another box below the details box.
13. Is there a way to export items?
14. How can we export characters if at all?
